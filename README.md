## Pseudocode
~~~
There are three quadrants: each quandrant contains a sleep and wake cycle.
Sleep cycle is the learning portion of each quadrant, or where datasets are stored.
Wake cycle uses what it's learned to come up with a result.
Each quandrant switches back to the sleep cycle, when switch to a new quandrant.
Switching between quandrants is based on a day / night cycle.
